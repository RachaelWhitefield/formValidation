# Form Validation

### Form Validation Using Regular Expressions

#### Users have to meet all the validation critera for each input box
* First name needs to be between 2 - 20 alpha characters
* Zip Code can be 5 digits alone or can include additional 4 if user knows theirs.  Both are acceptable.
* Email can be a combination of letters and numbers followed by the "@" and then allowed 2-5 characters for the domain.
* Phone number can be typed in any format to include spaces, no spaces, dashes, or dots between digit groupings ({area code ~ prefix ~ last 4 digits}).  

###### If the validation is not met a red alert message will appear below the input box to inform the user what sort of information/validation is required.
